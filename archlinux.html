    <h2>What is Arch Linux?</h2>   
    Arch Linux is a Linux distribution that adheres the "Keep It Simple, Stupid", or "KISS" principle. Originally created by Judd Vinet in 2002, it has now saved millions of lives of each Linux user from having their package manager go grazy, and having to experience bleeding-edge software without sacrificing stability.
    <h2>Should i use Arch Linux?</h2>
    If you're a newcomer to the world of Linux, it's recommended to not touch "bleeding-edge" distributions like Arch Linux. There have been cases of people with an Arch system having their own install being imploded by itself, due to mismanagement of packages, and the notorius "AUR", or Arch User Repository.
